# Swap Program Without Using Temporary Variable

This repository contains a C++ program that swaps the values of two integers **without using a temporary variable**. The program demonstrates two approaches:  
- Using **arithmetic operations**  
- Using **bitwise XOR operator**

---

## Problem Statement

Write a program to swap two numbers without using a third (temporary) variable.  

---

## How to Run

1. Compile the program:  
   ```bash
   g++ swappngWithoutThird.cpp -o swap
./swap
Enter two numbers: 5 10
Before swap: a = 5, b = 10
After swap: a = 10, b = 5
